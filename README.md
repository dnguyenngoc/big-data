# Big Data Distributed System

In the era of data, create a robust big data system using `JupyterLab`, `Airflow`, `Spark`, `Trino`, `Superset`, `MinIO`, `Kafka`, `Debezium`, and `Delta Lake`. Explore storage, analytics, and computing layers for cutting-edge capabilities.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to create a distributed data system capable of processing and analyzing large datasets from multiple sources and providing comprehensive reporting and data visualization for end-users.
